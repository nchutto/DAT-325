# DAT-325

This repository showcases my work for DAT 325: Data Validation, Quality, and Cleaning at Southern New Hampshire University, under the instruction of Professor Jennifer Johnson.

These projects demonstrate my ability to assess, clean, validate, and document data quality using real-world business integration scenarios. Each stage builds on the last, reflecting a structured, industry-standard data-quality process.

Project One – Data Quality Plan

# [DAT 325 Project One Nicole Hutto.docx]
Focus: Defining organizational goals and outlining a structured plan for ensuring data quality during a company merger.
Key Deliverables:

Established five core data-quality dimensions: accuracy, validity, completeness, consistency, and timeliness.

Created a governance framework outlining roles and responsibilities (data steward, custodian, security officer).

Cited industry best practices (Sebastian-Coleman, 2013; Rao & Selvamani, 2015) for data quality and cloud-security compliance.
Outcome: Developed a foundational strategy for reliable, compliant, and business-ready data.

Project Two – Executive Summary Report

# [DAT 325 Project Two - Nicole Hutto.docx]
Focus: Profiling and transforming the newly acquired firm’s HR dataset for merger readiness.
Key Deliverables:

Identified anomalies such as duplicate employee IDs, inconsistent date formats, and free-text categorical fields.

Proposed transformations: splitting full names, standardizing date formats, and recoding marital-status categories.

Used IBM Think resources on big data analytics to justify profiling and transformation approaches.
Outcome: Delivered a detailed plan ensuring the merged dataset met accuracy and consistency standards, minimizing integration errors.

Project Three – Data Validation Report

# [DAT 325 Project Three Nicole Hutto.docx]
Focus: Applying data validation and statistical checks to cleaned datasets.
Key Deliverables:

Reported row/column counts and summary statistics for quantitative fields (Age, Days Employed).

Identified and removed outliers, such as an impossible 52,246-day tenure (~143 years).

Created distribution plots to verify cleaned data integrity.
Outcome: Produced validated datasets ready for analytics and reporting, demonstrating real-world data-cleaning proficiency.
